    <<~EOS
      ContainerUI is not yet code-signed or notarized, so Gatekeeper will
      refuse to open it on first launch (reporting it as "damaged" or from an
      "unidentified developer"). Homebrew no longer bypasses Gatekeeper for you
      (the --no-quarantine flag was removed in Homebrew 5.1). After installing,
      clear the quarantine attribute yourself:

        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine #{appdir}/ContainerUI.app

      ContainerUI's UI runs on macOS 14+, but its container backend requires
      macOS 26 on Apple silicon. On older macOS or Intel Macs the app launches
      but backend features will not work.
